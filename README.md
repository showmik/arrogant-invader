# :space_invader: Arrogant Invader :rocket:

**Arrogant Invader** is my own version of the game *[Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)*

This game was made for learning purposes along with few other clones â€“ **[Tetris Drift](https://github.com/showmik/tetris-drift)** and the **[Crashy FO](https://github.com/showmik/crashy-fo)**.
